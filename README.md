My solutions for advent of code of 25' 

## Honor code

- No imports as far as practically possible, only built-ins, not even the standard lib
  - Permissable exception: It makes the solution extremely much simpler
- No LLM help in the code, just my own brain
- No cheating/looking at others solutions
  - Permissable exception: Re-using code from previous years solutions, if they fit the problem
